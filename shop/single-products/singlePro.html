        <!-- details -->
        <!-- CHEESE -->
        <!-- Cheese is a dairy product produced in a range of flavors, textures, 
            and forms by coagulation of the milk protein casein. It comprises proteins and fat 
            from milk (usually the milk of cows, buffalo, goats or sheep). During production, 
            milk is usually acidified and either the enzymes of rennet or bacterial enzymes with 
            similar activity are added to cause the casein to coagulate. The solid curds are then 
            separated from the liquid whey and pressed into finished cheese.[1] 
            Some cheeses have aromatic molds on the rind, the outer layer, or throughout. -->

            <!-- yogurt -->
            <!-- Yogurt (UK: /ˈjɒɡərt/; US: /ˈjoʊɡərt/,[1] from Ottoman Turkish: یوغورت, romanized: yoğurt;[a] also spelled yoghurt, yogourt or yoghourt) is a food produced by bacterial fermentation of milk.[2] Fermentation of sugars in the milk by these bacteria produces lactic acid, which acts on milk protein to give yogurt its texture and characteristic tart flavor.[2] Cow's milk is most commonly used to make yogurt. Milk from water buffalo, goats, ewes, mares, camels, and yaks is also used to produce yogurt. The milk used may be homogenized or not. It may be pasteurized or raw. Each type of milk produces substantially different results. -->

            <!-- panner -->
            <!-- Paneer is an important indigenous product which is obtained by heat treating the milk followed by acid coagulation using suitable acid viz. citric acid, lactic acid, tartaric acid, alum, sour whey. -->
            
            <!-- creambutter -->
            <!-- butter, a yellow-to-white solid emulsion of fat globules, water, and inorganic salts produced by churning the cream from cows' milk. Butter has long been used as a spread and as a cooking fat. It is an important edible fat in northern Europe, North America, and other places where cattle are the primary dairy animals.5 Apr 2024 -->
            
            <!-- ghee -->
            <!-- Ghee may be made of milk from various domesticated ungulates, such as cows, buffaloes and sheep. The composition of ghee varies depending on the animal whose milk has been used. The vitamin A content ranged from 315 to 375 μg per 100 grams. -->

            <!-- probiotic drinks -->
            <!-- With sufficient intake, probiotics can help restore the natural balance of gut bacteria. A probiotic drink mix can aid in preventing and treating diarrhoea. It reduces the risk causing factor. Probiotic drinks help improve symptoms of mental health disorders such as stress, anxiety, and depression.8 Nov 2021 -->

            <!-- milk -->
            <!-- Milk is the liquid produced by the mammary glands of mammals, including humans. Breast milk is the preferred food for infants, as it is well-tolerated while their digestive tracts develop and mature. Dairy milk may be introduced at later ages if tolerated well. -->

            <!-- pasture -->
            <!-- They can provide an economical source of livestock feed, reduce labor requirements, build soil tilth and fertility, reduce erosion, and reduce invasions of noxious and poisonous weeds. -->

            <!-- barley -->
            <!-- Grown in a variety of environments, barley is the fourth largest grain crop globally, after wheat, rice, and corn. Barley is commonly used in breads, soups, stews, and health products, though it is primarily grown as animal fodder and as a source of malt for alcoholic beverages, especially beer.31 Mar 2024 -->

            <!-- corn
            Corn is a tall annual cereal grass (Zea mays) that is widely grown for its large elongated ears of starchy seeds. The seeds, which are also known as corn, are used as food for humans and livestock and as a source of biofuel and can be processed into a wide range of useful chemicals.

            dry roughage
            Roughages are usually ground before they are pelleted, size of the pellets range from 12/64" o 48/64" (4.8 mm to 19.1 mm). Pelleted roughages weigh about 40 lb/cft as compared to 5-6 lb/cft for long hay. Pelleting poor quality roughages will markedly increase the consumption of roughage.

            Oats
            Oats are rolled or crushed into oatmeal or ground into fine oat flour. Oatmeal is chiefly eaten as porridge but may also be used oatcakes, oatmeal cookies, and oat bread and muesli and granola.

            straw
            Straw is an agricultural byproduct consisting of the dry stalks of cereal plants after the grain and chaff have been removed. It makes up about half of the yield by weight of cereal crops such as barley, oats, rice, rye and wheat.

            mixed feed
            a feed for livestock that consists of a mixture of wheat particles, bran, middlings, shorts, and other material in various proportions and is a by-product of flour milling.

            sorghum grain
            Sorghum grain is a feed crop in industrial nations and a food crop in several developing countries. Much of the sorghum grain used as food is used in porridge; relatively little is milled into flour. Its milling is similar to that of barley. Whole grain sorghum flour is used in the making of a bread, roti, in India.

            silage
            Silage is a type of fodder made from green foliage crops which have been preserved by fermentation to the point of acidification. It can be fed to cattle, sheep, and other such ruminants (cud-chewing animals).[2] The fermentation and storage process is called ensilage, ensiling, or silaging. Silage is usually made from grass crops, including maize, sorghum, or other cereals, using the entire green plant (not just the grain).

            cattle
            Cattle (Bos indicus and B. taurus) are the most common and widespread species of large ruminant livestock and are raised primarily to produce milk, meat and hides and to provide draft power. In grass-based systems they play an important role in nutrient recycling and convert human-inedible plant matter into protein.

            goats
            A goat is any ruminant and hollow-horned mammal belonging to the genus Capra. Related to the sheep, the goat is lighter in build and has horns that arch backward, a short tail, and straighter hair.11 Apr 2024

            pigs
            Pigs are stout-bodied, short-legged, omnivorous mammals, with thick skin usually sparsely coated with short bristles. Their hooves have two functional and two nonfunctional digits. Domestic North American pigs originated from wild stocks still found in European, Asian, and North African forests.11 Mar 2024

            sheep
            Male sheep are called rams, the females ewes, and immature animals lambs. Mature sheep weigh from about 35 to as much as 180 kg (80 to 400 pounds).

            chickens
            Chickens are average-sized fowls, characterized by smaller heads, short beaks and wings, and a round body perched on featherless legs. Exact size varies greatly among breeds, as does color. In many breeds, both sexes will have fleshy skin folds on the chin and atop the head, known as wattles and combs, respectively.
